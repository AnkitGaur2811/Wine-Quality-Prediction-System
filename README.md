# Wine Quality Prediction System

Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from grapes. Wine classification is a difficult task since taste is the least understood of the human senses. A good wine quality prediction can be very useful in the certification phase, since currently the sensory analysis is performed by human tasters, being a subjective approach. An automatic predictive system can be integrated into a decision support system, helping the speed and quality of the performance. Furthermore, a feature selection process can help to analyze the impact of the analytical tests. If it is concluded that several input variables are highly relevant to predict the wine quality, since in the production process some variables can be controlled, this information can be used to improve the wine quality.


## Problem Statement

Let’s assume we are working as data scientist in a firm which is going to set up a wine factory in near future. As Testing Quality of wine is crucial for any factory and it takes lot of time and efforts to do testing for samples. Hence, we are asked to make the process of wine quality testing less time consuming, and more cost effective. 
We propose to make a wine quality prediction system through which sample quality test is easy, less time consuming, and more cost effective. For this we employed Machine learning classification algorithm named Random Forest. Through this system we can get quality of wine in real time.

## Features

- By entering the Chemical Composition of Wine can Find Quality in real time


## File Summary and Usage

#### Main files
- **Wine Quality prediction.ipynb** -> This main file consisting of full script for the prediction System
- **winequality-red.csv** -> This is the file contaning data set used in the project

#### Report files

## Lessons Learned

- Learned Random Forest Classifier

- Learned to make a predictice system

- Learned to select importat features from Hord of features

- Learned about Label binarization, Corelation matrices etc.



## Deployment

To deploy this project 

- Open Wine Quality prediction.ipynb in your Jupyter notebook
- Run All Cells at once.
- User is prompt to enter chemical composition of Wine.
- After entering all the compostion you will find Quality of wine predicted



## Tech Stack

**Technology:** Python

**Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborne, Sci-kit learn

**Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier

**IDE Used:** Jupyter notebook




## Conclusion
- Based on the plots, we conclude that not all input features are essential and affect the data. therefore, we can drop some unnessary features while performing feature selection. 
- For classifying the wine quality, we have implemented Random Forest Classifier. We can achieve maximum accuracy of 85% using this model.
- At the end we made a predictive system that can be used by any one to have prediction about the quality of the wine they have.

## Future Scope
- By using a more optimized model and better computation techniques we will be able to increase the accuracy of these predictions. 
- Further, we can improve the user interface for a more user friendly and easy to use environment. 
- We can make this system more accessible for users who don’t have needed system configurations and software.
